# PreciseSchedule

This project is a rewrite of
[an old project](https://github.com/Joao-Arthur/CursoTecnico-TCC-PreciseSchedule)
I've writen in _Java_.

It is a monorepo with backend written in _Deno_ and frontend written
in _Next.js_. I've been using this project to practice programming.

## Philosophy

The **backend** is written with the biggest care, applying DDD and an
layered architecture. The **fronend** is written using a minimal
amount of abstraction.
