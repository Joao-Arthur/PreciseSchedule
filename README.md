# PreciseSchedule

This project is a rewrite of
[an old project](https://github.com/Joao-Arthur/CursoTecnico-TCC-PreciseSchedule) I've writen in
_Java_.

It is a monorepo with backend written in _Deno_ and frontend written in _Next.js_. I've been using
this project to practice programming.

## Philosophy

The **backend** is written with the biggest care, applying DDD and an layered architecture. The
**frontend** is written using a minimal amount of abstraction.
